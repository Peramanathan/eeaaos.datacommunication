\Chapter{Conclusion}
In this paper we proposed a novel solution for improving energy efficiency in smartphones as a cloud orchestration. We have explained the components of the orchestration and their functionalities. The architecture design is flexible so that new components can be added easily. The \emph{big data}, \emph{knowledge graph}, \emph{control box} will be accessible openly so that mass collaborators can participate and test. It will help improving the orchestrator implicitly or at the least for bug reporting. There is a potential that the big data knowledge would be useful in solving a number of other problems and enabling new services.
